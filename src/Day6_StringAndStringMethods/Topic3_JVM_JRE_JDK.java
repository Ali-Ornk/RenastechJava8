    JVM <- Java Virtual Machine
    The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is the virtual machine that runs the Java bytecodes. The JVM doesn't understand Java source code; that's why you need compile your *.java files to obtain *.class files that contain the bytecodes understood by the JVM.

    JVM is the Java Virtual Machine – it actually runs Java ByteCode.

    JRE <- Java Runtime Environment

    The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the libraries, the Java Virtual Machine, and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.

    JRE is the Java Runtime Environment – it contains a JVM, among other things, and is what you need to run a Java program.

    JDK <- Java Development Kit
    The JDK is a superset of the JRE, and contains everything that is in the JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and applications.
